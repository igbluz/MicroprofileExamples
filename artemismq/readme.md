# ArtemisMQ Sample

There is one microservice, artemismq-service-backend.

. In the `service-backend` directory, you can find a simple implementation for using Artemis.

For being able to run the sample just use ArtemisMQ local installation as described here: [ArtemisMQ Documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/using-server.html)

**Important** 
ArtemisMQ should after installation be available on Port 61616 with the default `user:password admin:admin`

Have a look in the `readme.md` file in each directory which describes how each project can be built and run.
